### Hi, I'm Matt, and I'm a classical musician turned software developer!

Before making this career switch, I dedicated myself to honing my skills as a classical musician, and I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything. However, when I realized it was time for a career change, I couldn't help but feel boxed in. I questioned if someone with my background would be able to transition into the tech industry. My musical journey was marked by countless hours of practice in a small room, focusing intensely on the technical aspects of my playing. I also spent significant time in rehearsals with ensembles, where we fine-tuned every nuanced moment in the music. It was in those moments that I learned the true art of collaboration, attention to detail, and the pursuit of excellence.

Here's the exciting partâ€”I've come to realize that the skills I developed during my time as a musician are not only valuable, but also highly transferable to the world of software development. Just as in music, the tech landscape is in a constant state of evolution. There's always something new to discover and learn, both individually and collaboratively. The meticulousness that was essential in creating memorable performances is equally vital when crafting clean, efficient code. And just as I learned to harmonize with colleagues in an ensemble, I've learned the importance of effective teamwork in building successful software projects.

If you're looking for a software developer who brings a unique blend of discipline, creativity, and a deep appreciation for collaborating, I'd love to connect with you! I'm also always down to talk tech, music, health and fitness, or trade travel stories.
Thanks for reading!
